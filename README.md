# SYN-Flood-Mitigation
This 3rd Semester Project was created to simulate a SYN Flood (DoS/DDoS) on a Server and it how it is mitigated via the Windows Firewall. It also contains email alerts, attack logs and blocked IP logs.

**Author**: Ibrar Ul Hassan Shami

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **All commands must be run in Command Prompt (CMD) with Administrator privileges.**
2. **Ignore all test files.**
3. Only these files are important:
   - `TCP Getting Interface.py`
   - `TCP Server Script.py`
   - `TCP Server Check.py`
   - `TCP Flood Script.py`
   - `TCP Mitigation Script.py`

## üñ•Ô∏è Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Setup

- Acquire **two PCs** on the **same internet connection** (one will act as **Server**, the other as **Attacker**).

---

### Step 2: Allow Python through Windows Firewall

Run the following commands on **both PCs** (adjust the path to your installed Python version if necessary):

```cmd
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="AllowPythonPrivate" dir=in action=allow program="C:\Users\DELL\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe" profile=private

Step 3: Enable ICMP (Ping) Communication
Allow ICMP traffic on both PCs:

cmd
Copy
Edit
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4-In" protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow
Test communication:

c
Copy
Edit
Attacker_PC: ping <Server_PC_IP>
Server_PC: ping <Attacker_PC_IP>
You can get the IP address by running ipconfig and checking the IPv4 Address.

Step 4: Allow Custom TCP Port
Allow TCP traffic through port 9999 on both machines:

cmd
Copy
Edit
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow TCP Port 9999" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=9999 action=allow
Step 5: Code Configuration
üíª Server PC Scripts:
TCP Getting Interface.py

TCP Server Script.py

TCP Mitigation Script.py

üß® Attacker PC Scripts:
TCP Server Check.py

TCP Flood Script.py

üîß Modify the following lines:
TCP Server Script.py

Line 7 ‚Üí Enter Server PC's IP

TCP Server Check.py

Line 3 ‚Üí Enter Server PC's IP

TCP Flood Script.py

Line 5 ‚Üí Enter Server PC's IP

Line 16 ‚Üí Enter Attacker PC's IP

Step 6: Configure Email Alerts (Optional but Recommended)
In PowerShell (Admin) on Server PC, set environment variables:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:SENDER_EMAIL="sender@gmail.com"
$env:RECEIVER_EMAIL="receiver@gmail.com"
$env:EMAIL_PASSWORD="xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
Verify the variables:

powershell
Copy
Edit
echo $env:SENDER_EMAIL
echo $env:RECEIVER_EMAIL
echo $env:EMAIL_PASSWORD
Now launch VS Code:

powershell
Copy
Edit
code .
Step 7: Running the Project
On Server PC:
cmd
Copy
Edit
python "TCP Getting Interface.py"
Note or remember the name of the active interface.

c
Copy
Edit
python "TCP Server Script.py"
On Attacker PC:
cmd
Copy
Edit
python "TCP Server Check.py"
Back to Server PC:
cmd
Copy
Edit
python "TCP Mitigation Script.py"
Enter appropriate values:

Example: Threshold: 3, Time: 10, then select your noted interface.

Finally, on Attacker PC:
cmd
Copy
Edit
python "TCP Flood Script.py"
‚úÖ Result
Watch the magic happen! The server should detect the SYN Flood and take mitigation actions (like blocking the attacker's IP and sending alerts via email).

üîç Final Note
Poke around and find out!
Explore the code, tweak the thresholds, and understand the working of real-time TCP flood detection.
